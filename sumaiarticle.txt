Article Summary: LLM Architectures Explained - NLP Fundamentals (Part 1)
Author: Vipra Singh
Published on Medium, August 15, 2024

This article provides a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its core techniques, offering foundational knowledge for understanding real-world applications of NLP models.

Key Topics Covered:
What is NLP?

NLP enables machines to manipulate and understand human language in its written and spoken forms. It is divided into two key areas:
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Interpreting the meaning of text.
Natural Language Generation (NLG): Producing human-like text.
Applications of NLP:

Sentiment Analysis: Detects emotional tone in text, used in customer feedback systems.
Toxicity Classification: Identifies hostile or harmful content for moderation.
Machine Translation: Converts text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracts and classifies entities (e.g., people, organizations) from text.
Spam Detection, Text Generation, Information Retrieval, and Summarization are also significant applications.
How NLP Works:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and normalization prepare text data for model input.
Feature Extraction: Methods such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, N-grams, and Word Embeddings create numeric representations of text data.
Modeling Techniques: Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are used for NLP tasks, including RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and BERT.
The Evolution of NLP:

The article traces NLPâ€™s history from rule-based systems (1950s) to the rise of neural networks (2010s), culminating in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLama.
Significant milestones include the introduction of RNNs, Word2Vec (2013), and Transformers (2017), which have revolutionized modern NLP tasks.
Comparative Analysis of NLP Models:

Discusses how newer models like Transformers outperform traditional methods like RNNs by handling long-range dependencies and offering better parallel processing capabilities.
Conclusion:

The article highlights the significance of understanding NLP fundamentals, preparing readers for more advanced topics like word embeddings, transformers, and the continued evolution of NLP.
This summary offers an overview of the main points discussed in the article and serves as a solid foundation for understanding the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).
