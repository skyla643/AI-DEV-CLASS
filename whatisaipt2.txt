Section II: Related Fields
In addition to AI, there are several closely related fields worth understanding. These include machine learning, data science, deep learning, and robotics.

1. Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of AI, though it often overlaps with fields like statistics. It enables systems to improve their performance over time with more experience or data.

Key Terminology:

Machine Learning: Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.
2. Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and, by extension, a subfield of AI. The "depth" refers to the complexity of the models used, made possible by modern computing power. It will be covered in more detail in Chapter 5 but is understood as a special type of machine learning that has led to significant advances in AI.

3. Data Science
Data science is an umbrella term that encompasses machine learning, statistics, certain aspects of computer science (such as algorithms and data storage), and web application development. It is a practical field that often requires domain-specific knowledge (e.g., business, science). Data science typically involves some AI, though not as much as headlines might suggest.

Key Elements of Data Science:

Machine learning
Statistics
Algorithms
Data storage
Domain-specific understanding
4. Robotics
Robotics involves building and programming robots to operate in complex, real-world environments. It is often seen as the ultimate challenge for AI because it requires combining many AI areas, such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and reasoning under uncertainty.

Examples of AI-Driven Components in Robotics:

Computer vision and speech recognition for sensing the environment
Natural language processing for understanding and processing instructions
Cognitive modeling and affective computing for human-robot interaction
Note: What is a Robot?
A robot is a machine that uses sensors to perceive its environment and actuators to act on it. While robots in popular culture are often humanoid, most real-world robots are designed for specific applications. Autonomous vehicles, for example, are considered robots, while software tools like chatbots, often called “software robots,” are not classified as robots.

Exercise 2: Taxonomy of AI
To classify fields into an Euler diagram, consider the relationships between AI, machine learning, computer science, data science, and deep learning:

AI: Section C – AI is the broadest concept, encompassing fields like machine learning, data science, and deep learning.
Machine Learning: Section D – A subset of AI, overlapping with fields like data science and statistics.
Computer Science: Section A – A broad field that includes AI and non-AI topics, intersecting with AI but not exclusively related to it.
Data Science: Section B – Overlaps with AI, particularly in the application of machine learning and statistics.
Deep Learning: Section E – A specific subfield of machine learning, contained within both machine learning and AI.
