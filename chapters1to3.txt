AI Learning Study Guide: Chapters 1-3
This study guide summarizes the key concepts and exercises I’ve completed in the Elements of AI course, focusing on Chapters 1-3. It includes references to my progress and files such as aiproblemsolving.txt, realworldai.txt, and others, which document my learning.

Progress Overview:

Exercises Completed: 13/25
Chapter 1: What is AI?
Key Sections and Concepts:
How Should We Define AI? AI is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, language understanding, and pattern recognition.

Related Fields: AI overlaps with fields like machine learning, data science, and robotics. Each contributes different methodologies to solve complex problems through automation and intelligence.

Philosophy of AI: Discusses whether machines can truly "think" and the ethical implications of AI. The Turing Test is a central concept here, evaluating whether a machine’s behavior is indistinguishable from human behavior.

Exercises Completed:
3/3 correct answers.
Chapter 2: AI Problem Solving
Key Sections and Concepts:
Search and Problem Solving:

Search Algorithms: Explore possible solutions systematically. Common strategies include:
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Heuristic-based methods like A* (A-star).
Games and Search: Problems like Towers of Hanoi illustrate how AI solves puzzles by navigating structured search spaces.
Solving Problems with AI: This section explores AI’s roots in search algorithms, inspired by Alan Turing. Concepts like game trees and the Minimax algorithm are discussed for AI applications in games.

Search and Games: In games like tic-tac-toe and chess, AI uses search trees to identify optimal moves. It applies concepts like:

Game trees
Maximizing/Minimizing value
Minimax algorithm
Key Exercise Example:
Exercise 7: Why so pessimistic, Max? Max, the player, must prevent Min, the opponent, from winning using the Minimax strategy.
Correct Answer: -1 (Min guarantees a win with optimal play).
Exercises Completed:
3/3 correct answers.
Chapter 3: Real World AI
Key Sections and Concepts:
Odds and Probability:

AI uses probability to handle uncertainty in real-world scenarios. For example, predicting weather or estimating the likelihood of rain is done by converting odds into probabilities.
Exercise 9: Converting odds for real-world events like the odds of rain in Helsinki (56.4%).
The Bayes Rule:

Bayes’ Rule updates the probability of an event based on new evidence. It’s commonly used in medical diagnoses and legal reasoning to weigh conflicting information.
Exercise 11: Applying Bayes’ rule to breast cancer diagnosis. Despite a positive test result, the posterior odds account for the test’s accuracy and prior probabilities.
Naive Bayes Classification:

Spam Filters: The Naive Bayes classifier is a practical application of Bayes' rule. It assumes conditional independence of words in a message and assigns likelihood ratios to classify an email as spam or ham.
Exercise 12: Calculating the posterior odds for the word “million” gives a result of 5.1, meaning that for every 10 ham messages, there are 51 spam messages.
Exercise 13: Classifying a message with multiple words using the Naive Bayes method.
Exercises Completed:
6/6 correct answers.
Summary of Exercises:
Chapter 1: Completed 100% of exercises.
Chapter 2: Working through problem-solving and game strategy algorithms.
Chapter 3: Mastered probability, Bayes’ rule, and classification techniques.
