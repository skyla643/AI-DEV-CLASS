Section I: How should we define AI?
In this section, we'll explore the concept of AI by looking into its definition and examples. AI is a broad and frequently discussed topic, with different interpretations depending on the person. Some define AI as advanced artificial life-forms, while others apply the term to almost any form of data processing.

To provide some clarity, we’ll begin by discussing the definition of AI and its related fields. To illustrate different aspects of AI, we’ll explore three major applications: self-driving cars, content recommendation, and image/video processing.

Application 1: Self-Driving Cars
Self-driving cars use a combination of AI techniques such as:

Search and planning to find the best routes.
Computer vision to detect obstacles.
Decision making under uncertainty to manage dynamic environments.
Implications:

Improved road safety.
Enhanced logistics efficiency.
Shift of human roles toward supervision.
Application 2: Content Recommendation
Content recommendation algorithms personalize information on platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, Spotify, and Netflix. These algorithms are based on AI, and they determine what content users see.

Implications:

Potential for filter bubbles, echo chambers, fake news, and propaganda.
Application 3: Image and Video Processing
Face recognition and image manipulation are used in various applications such as photo organization, automatic tagging, and even generating fake videos that look real.

Implications:

Challenges in distinguishing between real and fake video content.
What is, and what isn’t AI?
The definition of AI is not straightforward. Let’s explore a few reasons:

No official definition: AI researchers have no universally agreed definition.
The legacy of science fiction: Popular media often distorts public perceptions of AI.
Easy tasks for humans are hard for AI: For example, grasping objects is a challenging task for robots.
Hard tasks for humans are easy for AI: Playing chess or solving math problems can be simpler for AI.
Key Terminology
Autonomy: Ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant user guidance.
Adaptivity: Ability to improve performance through learning from experience.
Suitcase Words:
Words like "learning," "understanding," and "intelligence" often carry multiple meanings, leading to confusion about AI's capabilities.
